Greetings, fellow Yahoo!Messenger user!

I, KassRo, have made my own my mission to populate the skins list or change the original look of Yahoo!Messenger using VOCALOID/UTAULOIDS that I can work with.

These are simply the original skins, but modified to work with all the LOIDS I've done.

## I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE ART THAT HAS BEEN ADDED INTO THE SKINS! ALL CREDITS GO TO THE ORIGINAL OWNERS! ##

References and notes:

- #[file name] are files that currently do not work, but I am looking for a fix.

- Some skins might seem like they are broken. That is not entirely right, but not totally wrong, either. I plan on reworking all skins once I understand XML better or someone is nice enough to give me a hand.

- The skins have been done after long breaks between them, so they might have different styles/"quality", which I will modify later on.

Upcoming skins:

- Original skins, with no base skin to adapt:
	- Akita Neru
	- Kagamine Rin & Kagamine Ren
	- Megurine Luka

- Base skins with overlays:
	- GUMI - Fantasia Green
	- Uta Utane / Defoko - Purple

And more...
