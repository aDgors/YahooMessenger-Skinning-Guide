## Yahoo!Messenger

Yahoo! Messenger (sometimes abbreviated Y!M) was an instant messaging client and associated protocol created and formerly operated by Yahoo!. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Messenger))

## Details

As of 2024, misboon took the challenge of reviving the client and gathering a small number of developers/designers to work on the project, currently known as [BuZZd! Chat](https://buzzd.chat/).

## Why did I do this?

As one of the people out of my generation to have used Y!M in the past, I challenged myself by making custom skins, starting with VOCALOID characters as a base for my ideas.

## About me

I'll start with thanking you for checking my guide, bonus points if it helps you in any way.

I'm just a guy who prefers more *vintage* things - games, designs, gadgets and so on.

Currently, my only successfull projects are:

[KassRo's Hub](https://kassro.neocities.org/) - My personal page, where you can see a more in-depth description of me, along with other things I like, games I play(ed) and projects I've made, along with a few miscellaneous things I've added.

[Yahoo!Messenger Skinning Guide](https://github.com/KassRo26/YahooMessenger-Skinning-Guide)

But I plan on making many more!
